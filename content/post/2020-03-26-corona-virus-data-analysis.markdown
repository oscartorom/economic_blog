Interest in the development of the Corona Virus and its impact on the world has increased as it has affected almost everyone in the world. In this article I will perform some analysis on the cases, how they have been progressing and what is the outlook for the world by using statistical techniques.







## Global outlook

Up to today's date, 174 countries have presented **corona** virus cases. This roughly represents 89% of the whole world.

Additionally, the number of cases has been increasing exponentially all over the globe, almost reaching 600,000 confirmed cases up to today.

It can be observed as well that daily ocurrences have increased significantlly, having over 60,000 new detected cases daily in the world.

This is quite alarming as we can see an increase in outliers, days where over 30,000 cases are detected.
