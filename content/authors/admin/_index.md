The one who turned the world.
Economic analysis, events and policy implications and forecasting techniques. 

The name comes from the Inka Pachacuti, he who overturns space and time, or the one who turned the world.
We look to analyse and predict the impact of economic events and policies which could led to major changes in how people live, focusing on data driven analysis.
The major contribution is explaining effects in an easy-digestible way while at the same time using comprehensive research techniques which validates the results obtained.
